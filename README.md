# MNIST Digit Classification

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is composed of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9).

## Model Architecture
- 3 Convolutional Layers
- MaxPooling
- Flatten
- Fully Connected Dense Layer
- Dropout
- Softmax Output

## Training Results
- Trained for 10 epochs
- Achieved test accuracy > 98%
